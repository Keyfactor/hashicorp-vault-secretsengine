Note: The sha256 checksum for this build is provided along with the release.  
Use this value for <checksum> in the below steps.

sha256 checksum: <checksum>

1) make sure the vault is unsealed

2) make sure that $env:VAULT_ADDR is set appropriately
   - VAULT_ADDR is the url for the instance of vault, example: http://127.0.0.1:8200
   
3) disable and deregister a previous version of the plugin (if installed) by running:
	
	> vault secrets disable <instance name>; vault plugin deregister secret <instance name>

4) run the following command to register the plugin:

	> vault plugin register -sha256=<checksum> -command="keyfactor.exe" secret keyfactor    

** the "command" value should correspond to the name of the binary.  For Windows, this will be "keyfactor.exe", for linux this will be "keyfactor".	
** the last parameter ("keyfactor") corresponds to the name of the instance of the secrets engine and can be set to whatever identifier you choose.

5) enable the keyfactor secrets engine by running:

	> vault secrets enable <instance name>

6) test the connection by requesting the ca

	> vault read <instance name>/ca


where "keyfactor" is the name of the plugin instance
